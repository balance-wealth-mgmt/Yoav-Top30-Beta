st.markdown("""
**Perimeter Solutions appears to possess elements of a _narrow economic moat_ due to:**

- **Specialized Niche**: One of the few global suppliers of wildfire retardants and foams, with contracts from agencies like the U.S. Forest Service.
- **High Switching Costs**: Government clients are locked in due to regulatory and logistical barriers.
- **Regulatory Barriers**: Compliance-heavy certification processes limit competition.
- **R&D and Technical Expertise**: Proprietary formulations and additive innovations strengthen product defensibility.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Weaknesses:**

- **Low ROIC and High EV/FCF**: Indicate operational inefficiencies or capital intensity.
- **Unpredictable Revenue**: Wildfire-dependent demand introduces seasonal volatility.

---

### üîç Conclusion:
PRM exhibits a **narrow moat**, supported by regulatory and technical barriers. However, **financials do not yet demonstrate durable competitive advantage**, keeping its moat **qualitative rather than deeply entrenched**.
